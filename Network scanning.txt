network scanning:-


1. Purpose of the program
This program scans a local network to find all active devices and displays their IP addresses and MAC addresses.


2. ASCII banner
The large text at the beginning is only for display and author credit. It does not affect how the program works.


3. Importing libraries

scapy: Used for creating and sending network packets.

argparse: Used to read IP addresses or ranges from the command line.



4. Command-line arguments (get_arguments)
This function asks the user to enter a target IP address or IP range using -t or --target.
If no IP is provided, the program shows an error message.


5. ARP request creation
The program creates an ARP request to ask devices on the network, “Who has this IP address?”


6. Broadcast frame
The ARP request is wrapped inside an Ethernet frame and broadcast to all devices using the MAC address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.


7. Sending and receiving packets (scan)
The program sends the broadcast ARP packet and waits for replies from devices that are active on the network.


8. Collecting responses
Each responding device sends back its IP address and MAC address, which the program stores in a list.


9. Data storage
The IP and MAC addresses are saved in dictionary format for easy handling.


10. Displaying results (print_result)
The program prints all discovered IP and MAC addresses in a neat table format.


11. Main execution
The program:

Reads the target IP

Scans the network

Displays the connected devices



12. Final outcome
The user gets a clear list of all devices connected to the local network.
